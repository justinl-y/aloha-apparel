## Personal Learning

This project allowed me to learn use of CSS media queries to implement changing layouts for a required web design of mobile, tablet and desktop resolutions.

I also learned the process for creating web font kits of differing font file formats from design font requirements and how to include Font Awesome icons in my web pages.
  
Implementation of functionality for email validation allowed me to understand control statements in JavaScript.

Use of JQuery allowed me to understand manipulation of DOM elements and integration of the project with JQuery plugins.
